# Emotion Recognition on Masked Faces

Face detection algorithms have become ubiquitous and the need for human emotion detection is only on the rise. Studies have shown that computer vision and various machine learning techniques can be applied to the identification and classification of such emotions. However, as it is becoming increasingly common for individuals to wear face masks in their day-to-day life. Our goal is to use a neural network to implement a deep learning network that identifies emotions from pictures of a masked individualâ€™s face.

## Data Processing

Main dataset: [Kaggle Facial Expression Recognition Challenge dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/debanga/facial-expression-recognition-challenge)

Pre-processing python script: data_processing/data_zenify/data_kaggle.py

## Model

Model training python script: model/model_train.py

## Data Analysis

Data analysis python notebook: data_analysis/analysis.ipynb

The python notebook takes the final test set true labels from the dataset and the predicted labels of our models to create:
- Confusion matrix of the predicted labels
- Bar plots of the distribution of true and predicted labels
- Overall accuracy score of the predicted labels
The predicted labels and resulting data analysis graphs for each model can be found in their respectively named folders.
